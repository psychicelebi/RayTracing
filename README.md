# Ray Tracer

This is a Ray Tracer built as a learning project following [The Cherno's Ray Tracing series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98edc5GshdBtREv5asFW3yXl&si=ZwHQRIjvuAOiruBz). The goal is to understand the fundamentals of graphics programming (particularly ray tracing) and practice implementing C++.
